# Tabletop platform

This is an app that I'm creating as part of my engineering thesis.

The main goal is to be able to add certain games to shelves.

The project is using:
- Spring MVC
- H2 database (for now)
- Lombok
- Hibernate

The front-end will be created using my very limited knowledge about React.
